FAQ

What is WallStreetBets Token?

WallStreetBets is a cryptocurrency token made for the community, by the community (yes, the real WallStreetBets community from Reddit). Most of us there are retail traders, but we also have access to a very talented team of developers. Considering the current surge in retail traders vs hedge funds/Wall Street Suits, we are planning on making this token yet another tool for the community to use to give us an edge over them. (Note that, at the moment, @WSBChairman and @WSBMods from Twitter are NOT part of the team).

Who are developers behind the project:

The team was formed after some discussions about creating a WSB themed token, primarily as a meme to start with, but as discussions progressed, the idea for WBS token grew. The team are mostly active traders that all met on WSB reddit.
r/wsb mods are not part of the team

Why is there no Roadmap, and Whitepaper?

A whitepaper is not yet required. The future of the token is decided by the community, not by the developers.

To show we are here for the long term, presale funds have been locked for 2 years. Community will later decide whatâ€™s done with these tokens. This could be exchange listings, dividing it among current holders, marketing, influencers. You can check the status of the locked funds here. https://team.finance/view-coin/0x8D554DB662583d4E3B7d61514da7b79e023aE94d
