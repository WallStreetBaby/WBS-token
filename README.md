FAQ

What is WallStreetBets Token?

  - WallStreetBets is a cryptocurrency token made for the community, by the community (yes, the real WallStreetBets COMMUNITY from Reddit, most of us there are retail traders, but we also have developers. have also to say, for the moment @WSBChairman, and @WSBMods from Twitter are not part of the team. We have to say that for legal reasons, But we still hope that WBS will grow to one of the best cryptocurrency in the world, controlled only by the community itself.). WallStreetbets token is a way to fight for our freedom, hedge fund and Wall Street Suits. (WBS – not WSB this way shows that we are not associated with Wall Street Bets).

Who are developers behind the project:
    - WallStreetBets COMMUNITY from Reddit as we mentioned before. 


Why are the names of developers not public?
We don't want one name (or few names) behind the project, and we want to be community-based as we said.

Why is there no Roadmap, and Whitepaper?

We don't know where the token goes and in which direction, we don't decide, only token holders. Will we become Governance Token and then airdrop a new token to all WBS holders, or the community just wants it to stay a meme token, and have it for sentimentality, it’s all up to the token holders.
